# tidy_dump
tidy_dump() is an different approach to PHP's var_dump.

In tidy_dump dumped data is displayed as HTML table rather than plain text, so that developer can easily understand data. 

This project is in its early stage. For now, only the simple data types like boolean, integer, double and string can dumped.

In future functionality to dump complex data types like sequential, multidimensional and associative arrays, object etc will be added.

To test, download  code and run the test.php. Also see demo.htm to view the example outputs.

Why tidy_dump() project:
------------------------
I am basically a ColdFuison developer, while learning PHP first thing I noticed is the var_dump() function which is similar to writeDump() function in ColdFusion. 

ColdFusion writeDump() displays data in graphical way so that the developer can quickly understand the content of dump.

Also our brain can quickly recognize a graphical presentation of data than a textual presentation data.

Thus my project is to graphically represent var_dump() data so that developer can easy understand it.
